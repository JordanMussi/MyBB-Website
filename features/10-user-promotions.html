<h2>
	Automatically promote users based on their post count, reputation or registration date</h2>
<p>
	Also available in MyBB is a user promotions system whereby a user can be promoted to a new primary user group or a new additional user group when they reach a specific combination based on the number of posts they’ve made, the reputation they’ve received or the registration date.</p>

<p>
	User promotions cover one of the most popular requests we receive, for forum administrators to give special privileges to members after they've been registered for a few months.</p>
<p>
	As a forum administrator, you can define as many different group promotions based on different criteria, and MyBB will automatically, via the <a href="/features/tasks">task system</a> promote users based on the rules on a regular basis.</p>
