# Latest Version Information
## Guarantee of latest updates

Make sure to obtain the software packages from official sources. The [Download page]({{ site.url }}/download/) always shows the most recent available version and the [MyBB Blog](https://blog.mybb.com) contains official announcements related to the Project.

You can get notified of updates by:
 - subscribing to the [MyBB Blog](https://blog.mybb.com),
 - following [@mybbsecurity on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mybbsecurity) (security-related releases),
 - following [@mybb on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mybb) (all releases),
 - checking for updates in your Admin Control Panel's _Home_.

Links to latest Release Blog Posts are also pinned in the `#18-support` channel on our [Discord server](https://mybb.com/get-involved/discord/).

Additionally, we recommend subscribing to used plugins and themes on the [Extend](https://community.mybb.com/mods.php) section to get notified of extension updates.
# Checksums
## Integrity of downloaded packages

_Checksums are short chunks of text which can verify that files were downloaded correctly. MyBB publishes checksums generated by `SHA-512`, `SHA-256`, `SHA-1` and `MD5` hash algorithms (strongest to weakest &mdash; checking `SHA-512` is recommended)._

After downloading the package, its checksum should be compared to the one that was published.

- **Linux** &mdash; Terminal

  ```
  sha512sum filename.zip
  ```

- **Mac OS X** &mdash; Terminal

  ```
  shasum --algorithm 512 filename.zip
  ```

- **Windows** &mdash; Command Prompt

  ```
  CertUtil -hashfile filename.zip SHA512
  ```

- **Windows** &mdash; PowerShell

  ```
  Get-FileHash filename.zip -Algorithm SHA512 | Format-List
  ```

# Signatures
## Integrity &amp; Authenticity of downloaded packages

_Digital signatures, when checked against public keys, show whether certain data was signed using private keys owned by developers, thus allowing to verify the authenticity of published packages. Make sure your system has [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/download/index.html) installed (version 2.1 or higher is recommended) to be able to use the commands below._

1. **Fetch the [list of MyBB Signing Keys](https://mybb.com/download/keys/)** used to sign official releases and import them:

   ```
   curl https://mybb.com/download/keys/raw.txt | gpg --import
   ```

   You can also download the above URL manually and import it with `gpg --import raw.txt`.

2. **Verify the signature** of the downloaded file:

   - `gpg --verify filename.zip.asc`

   	 where _filename.zip.asc_ is a file containing signatures for _filename.zip_.

   - Alternatively, you can use

     ```
     gpg --verify - filename.zip
     ```

     to have GnuPG check the signature of _filename.zip_ that will be pasted into the Terminal/Command Prompt (_stdin_).

     Once pasted, press **Ctrl + D** (`^D`) and **Enter** on Linux, or **Ctrl + Z** (`^Z`) and **Enter** on Windows.

### Key verification
All code signing keys are maintained in accordance with the Project's [**MyBB Signing Keys Protocol**]({{ site.url }}/download/keys/protocol). Each key:
 - is listed on [mybb.com/download/keys/](https://mybb.com/download/keys/),
 - contains a comment `CODE SIGNING KEY`,
 - is active and belongs to a Team member at the time of release,
 - has a corresponding _`Adding...`_ announcement with its fingerprint on [twitter.com/mybbsecurity](https://twitter.com/mybbsecurity),
 - does **not** have a corresponding _`Removing...`_ announcement with its fingerprint on [twitter.com/mybbsecurity](https://twitter.com/mybbsecurity),
 - has been added at least 14 days before the signing date,
 - is signed by its owner with a key listed on [mybb.com/about/team/](https://mybb.com/about/team/),
 - is signed by a current Role Leader, other than the key's owner, listed on [mybb.com/about/team/](https://mybb.com/about/team/).

 Note that the [keys file](https://mybb.com/download/keys/raw.txt) is updated with revoked keys and new signatures when changes occur.
